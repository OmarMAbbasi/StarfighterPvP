StarfighterPvP is an arcade style game that one can play with up to four players. The game will be played over several rounds 
where players must maneuver around moving hazards while trying to destroy each other's ships. Points will be rewarded for each
ship destroyed and deducted for each death. Between rounds, players will be able to choose from a list of powerups that can
affect players and hazards alike. The player with the most points at the end of all of the rounds will be declared the winner. 
Additionally, the top scores will be displayed for anyone playing the game to see.
